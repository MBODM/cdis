# cdis
A tiny command line tool to change a display´s input source by using DDC

This tool is the result of my experiments in the [ControlDisplayInputSource](https://github.com/MBODM/ControlDisplayInputSource) repository. The tool is written in [Go (golang)](https://go.dev/) and it´s named `cdis.exe`, where `cdis` stands for **C**hange**D**isplay**I**nput**S**ource.
